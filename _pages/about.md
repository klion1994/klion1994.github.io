I am currently working toward a Ph.D. degree in the college of computer science at Inner Mongolia University advised by Prof. [Baoqi Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=niymf28AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My research interests lie in smart sensing, mobile computing, indoor localization and navigation.

Previously, I received a B.E. degree in 2017 and an M.S. degree in 2019 from Inner Mongolia University.  During my Ph.D. study, I was awarded several scholarships, including the National Scholarship in 2020 and the Academic scholarship of Inner Mongolia autonomous region in 2021.
